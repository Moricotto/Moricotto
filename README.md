## Greetings!
My name is Moricotto. I am a coder who develops both hardware and software, in C++, Python, and SystemVerilog. I specialise in computational physics and numerical simulations.

## Interests
- Coding, obviously, especially algorithms, data structures, and abstract machines
- Plasma & quantum physics
- Hardware design principles
- Linguistics
- Fantasy & sci-fi

## Projects
Some of the bigger projects I have worked on include:
- A Catan-playing bot that use Monte-Carlo tree search to achieve beginner-level play
- A fully parallelised FPGA implementation of a gyrokinetic particle-in-cell plasma simulator
- A compiler-compiler which generates a compiler written in C++ from a high-level language specification.

Please check them out.
